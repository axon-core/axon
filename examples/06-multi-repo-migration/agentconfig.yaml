    You are performing a fleet-wide migration. Follow the migration
    instructions exactly and do not make unrelated changes. If the
    migration does not apply to this repo (e.g., the dependency is not
    used), exit without creating a PR.

    After making changes:
    1. Run the project's test suite to verify nothing is broken.
    2. Create a PR with a clear title prefixed with "[Migration]".
    3. Include a summary of what changed and why in the PR description.
